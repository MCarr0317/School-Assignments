What this code currently does:
1. takes a possibly nested sql selection query
2. parses it down into usable objects
3. rebuilds the query

Todo:
1. write code that replaces SQL tokens with relational algebra tokens
  - write code to insert cartesian product and parenthesis  
2. write code to reorder clauses to valid RelAlg.
  - write code to re-nest statements for pretty output of query, but don't re-nest them in the internal structure
3. write code to generate initial query tree
4. write code to optimize tree
5. write code to output optimized tree
