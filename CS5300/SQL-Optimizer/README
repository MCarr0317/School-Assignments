What this code currently does:
1. Takes a possibly nested sql selection query
2. Parses it down into usable objects
3. Rebuilds the query
4. Generated DOT code to visualize the graph using GraphViz

Todo:
1. Properly distrubute Cross products over relations, instead of having one X for any amount of relations.
2. Code UNION, EXCEPT, and INTERSECT query handlers and the logic for generating a Tree from nested queries. Right now the app goes into an infinite loop on these.
3. Write code to optimize tree
