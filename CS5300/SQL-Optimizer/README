What this code currently does:
1. Takes a possibly nested sql selection query
2. Parses it down into usable objects
3. Rebuilds the query
4. Generated DOT code to visualize the graph using GraphViz

Todo:
1. Properly distrubute Cross products over relations, instead of having one X for any amount of relations.
2. Implement the schemas provided with the test data to make wildcard selections translate into the list of all attributes for that schema. 
2. Code UNION, EXCEPT, and INTERSECT query handlers and the logic for generating a Tree from nested queries.
3. Change code to work on queries that are nested where the nested query contains a join operation.
4. Write code to optimize tree
