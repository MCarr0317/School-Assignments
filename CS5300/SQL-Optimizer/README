What this code currently does:
1. takes a possibly nested sql selection query
2. parses it down into usable objects
3. rebuilds the query

Todo:
1. write code that replaces SQL tokens with relational algebra tokens
  - write code to insert cartesian product and parenthesis  
2. write code to reorder clauses to valid RelAlg.
3. write code to generate initial query tree
4. write code to optimize tree
