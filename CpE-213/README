This is code written for the Simon2 board, found here: https://sites.google.com/a/mst.edu/introtocpe/home/simon2-board

The functional requirements we created were 
1. Implement a binary increment/decrement counter using two buttons. The count was displayed on 4 of the 9 LED's. Incrementing at a current count of 15 would reset the counter to 0, and vice versa.
2. Play music through the speaker on the board. For this we had to generate the frequencies of the square waves to pass to the speaker.
3. Implement a method for communicating with a desktop computer using serial communication to display information about the songs that could be played on the board. Sort of acting like a menu.
