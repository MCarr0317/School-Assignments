Modulo Division
1. Establish the dividend to be "A" and the divisor as "B"
2. Calculate (A/B)
3. Truncate (A/B) to the nearest whole number
4. Multiply the whole number by B
5. Subtract product from A to get end result.
e.g. A mod B = A - (B * int(A/B))
     19 mod 4 = 19 - (4 * int(19/4)) = 19 - 16 = 3

Alternate Module Division:
1. Establish the dividend to be "A" and the divisor as "B"
2. Calculate A/B
3. Subtract the int(A/B) from (A/B), name this number as C.
4. Multiply C by B to get final answer.
e.g. A mod B = ((A/B) - int(A/B)) * B
     19 mod 4 = ((19/4) - int(19/4) * 4 = (4.75 - 4) * 4 = 3
     
       
Life is Good
1. fold the string in half, fourths, and eights. Mark the 4 inch, 2 inch, and 1 inch lines, respectively.
2. Stretch string along measured object.
3. Mark where end of string lies on object, then remove string and place the begging on the mark.
4. Measure with the smaller segments if remaining length of object exceeds length of bigger segments.
5. Count how many segments of each length it took to reache nd of object.
6. Multiply by respective segments, add products together.

Maze
constant: always check for changes in walls around you.
1. If more than one starting direction, pick random direction using the randomize function.
2. Float in that direction.
3. Count how many drops of ink you drop in each particular direction.
4. If tentacles sense change in possible directions around you, randomly pick direction other then direction you came.
5. If tentacles sense wall ahread, use tentacles to search for other walls around you, repeat #3
6. If there are no new directions, trace back your ink drops to where you started by recounting them and making sure both numbers match.
7. Float in direction without any ink drops in it.
8. Repeat from step #1.
